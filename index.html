    ">About Me</h2>
    <p> Student of the web by day, gamer by night. Hey everyone! Aspiring software engineer here, thus far I'm novice level with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. What you're about to see is my first attempt at making a website. My plan is to take this site and evolve it over time, evolve it into something I can be proud to call me own.
        My interests revolve heavily around cars, gaming and overall adventure! My background and career history to date laregely involves working in the automotive industry as a Service advisor and a few years doing inside sales. I'm excited to dive into the world of Coding!  </p>

        "> Experience </h3>
        <p>As both a car guy and former salesman, I could teach the average person a thing or two about either. In the world of code I'm brand new and eager to learn.
            Thus far I've gotten a basic grasp of HTML, CSS and JavaScript!
